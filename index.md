I am a Systems Analyst Researcher at [Renaissance Technologies](https://www.rentec.com/Home.action?index=true). 

I received my PhD in 2024 from the [PDOS](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/) lab at MIT EECS, where my work focused on making datacenters faster and more resource-efficient. My broader research interests span operating systems, distributed systems, and hardware/software co-design.<br>
